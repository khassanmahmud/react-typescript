# What I have done?

Ok, so I was focused on first user story, where I fetched all of the launches data for the ploting map. But unfortunately I did not able to render the map
because it requires Google map API key. And I really dont know how to render google map without API key.

## If I had time.

I used here axios for data fetching from the API and I tried to use google-react-map for map rendering. I think this library is perfect for serves our requirements.

I think If I had time, I will make an app where I can utilize all of the APIs of this library for rocket mission so that all the people who are fond of SpaceX, they can use this app for fun and enjoy the stuffs. I dont know may be I will create an app for myself based on this API library. :)
